=============================================

I noticed there was a lot of information being about Supreme Court vacancies
during election years being presented in the media and wanted to see for myself
what a complete picture looked like. Unable to find the information compiled
anywhere, I instead ended up with quite the project. It's *still* not 100%
complete but it may be the most complete information currently available.

I've presented it here sans-analysis so people may reach their own conclusions.
