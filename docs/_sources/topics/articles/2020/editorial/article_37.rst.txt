Fox News Fakes Protest Images
=============================

I ran across an image on Reddit that was on the Fox News homepage. People were
accusing it of being badly photoshopped so I downloaded it to take a look.

Okay well - that dude does really look kinda odd there. So I zoomed in a bit:

Haha okay. Yea. That's completely terrible. They didn't even try that hard.
Maybe it was just supposed to be a recreation or something, although at the
time there wasn't anything on the website saying so. Such weird faking is a
pretty interesting story all on it's own. But then...

Someone else on a totally different subreddit posted another link to a Fox News
article which included this image:

   :align: center

I noticed something pretty funny. I bet you can too! I mean, wow this guy
really gets around to protests, AND he is really good at staying in the same
pose!

This time though they don't even bother trying to smooth out the sides.
Someone spent less time with this edit than the other one, clipping the dudes
arm off partially:

   Hilariously Fake.

Here, let me help fix the fake for you Fox News. I'm available for hire and my
skills are going to top this shoddy work.

   It took less than 10 seconds to fake this better.

I'm not a professor journalistic ethics or anything but this seems pretty
disingenuous. Going back to one of the stories now:
https://www.foxnews.com/us/black-lives-matter-protesters-seattle-chaz-hijacked-message
I see they have changed the images and now include the following apology

    *Editor's Note: A FoxNews.com home page photo collage which originally
    accompanied this story included multiple scenes from Seattle's "Capitol
    Hill Autonomous Zone" and of wreckage following recent riots. The collage
    did not clearly delineate between these images, and has since been
    replaced. In addition, a recent slideshow depicting scenes from Seattle
    mistakenly included a picture from St. Paul, Minnesota. Fox News regrets
    these errors.*

I don't think you should have altered images on any news story even if you put
a note under it saying that you made up the image. Journalism deserves much
better than this.
