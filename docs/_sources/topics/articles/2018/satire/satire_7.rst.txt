Bret Kavanaugh is an Obliviator!
================================

In 1980, Bret Kavanaugh was an outgoing party hardened and frat-tastic fuckboy.
Clownery and binge drinking couldn't hold this man back. Being white,
privileged, rich, and well endowed this man has had nothing short of a "Teen
Movie" award winning climb to the top. With a stealthy history of fuckery,
Kavanaugh ascended through the ranks of our political high society, becoming a
member on one of the highest Circuit Courts in the US justice system!

Thousands of dollars have been dumped into the edge of your seat research from
political foes around the country. Is FBI full of a bunch of sour dough
pussies that couldn't even uncover the biggest cover up in modern history, or is
something bigger at play here? Why 30, years into the future, are these
accusations being levied? The true answer might just surprise you, and
even Q.

Murder, Death, Kill, Obliviate! You heard it. Kavanaugh's accusations are oddly
close to those of the Clinton regime with whom it is said Bret Kavanaugh had
close contact. From dumpster to desert, you do not want to cross Kavanaugh.
While many believe the *six* FBI background checks had freed him from all wrong
doing, we really know what's going on. Mysterious loss of accounts, hazy
memories, and disappearances make it clear Bret Kavanaugh is a Wizard. You
heard it, from one of the most renowned authors, J.K. Rowling, Bret Kavanaugh
has performed multiple memory charms and even—in some cases—bestowed a death
curse upon his enemies.

Linking back to the Clinton Regime it is obvious that all the mysterious
disappearances are now coming to the forefront. Trained by Hilary herself, Bret
mastered the art of "washing the evidence". Asinine Media reports it first.
Brace yourself, Wizards are among us, and there is about to be another war.
We must protect ourselves, and our minds. The government is being taken over by
trickery and shadow war.

There is hope. Evidence has been leaked online that Dr. Emmet Brown is working
on a time machine. This will be capable of going back to the future to stop
Kavanaugh before he commits these egregious acts, and seals his fate of séance
and magic. We must stand together in these trouble times. Down with
Kavanaugh!!!!
