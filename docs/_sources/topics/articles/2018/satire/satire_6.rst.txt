When asked about the Nike advertisement that featured Colin Kaepernick and
whether US Army Corporal Pat Tillman would have been a better choice to depict
the virtue of sacrifice, President Trump responded, "He's a war hero because he
was killed. I like people who weren't killed."

Democrats immediately pounced on the remarks, claiming that the President's
comments were insensitive and indicated he had little respect for American
troops who died in combat.

Even some Republicans joined in criticizing the President, including the
administration's own Secretary of Energy, Rick Perry, "Pat Tillman is an
American hero and all troops killed in action deserve our nation's highest debt
of gratitude. The President's comments are distasteful."

Shortly after, Trump released a statement saying, "I am not a fan of Pat
Tillman because he has done so little for our Veterans."

Trump added that he has, "great respect for all those who serve in our military
including those that weren't killed and are also heroes."

Pat Tillman was not available for comment.
