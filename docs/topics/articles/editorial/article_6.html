</div>
<p>At this point the term “politically correct” or PC for short, has taken on a
life of it’s own. It’s used to disparage aspects of communication, often with
the subtext of implying negative motivations. Hence people engaging in speech
that isn’t politically correct are labeled racist, sexist, xenophobic, or any
other variety of negatively perceived labels. Taken from a different
perspective it’s used as a catch-all that indicates excessive sensitivities.
Within todays political climate it also acts as a stand-in for the composed and
scripted nature of the political show.</p>
<p>Trump has used a lack of politically correct speech to convey a feeling of
reality that those in the political establishment [Clinton] are completely
devoid of. He is often heralded for his ability to “tell it like it is” without
being restricted by the irrelevant nuisance of fitting what he says into a nice
politically correct box.</p>
<p>While obviously not directly invoking the phrase “politically correct”, Clinton
has used the mantra of political correctness to vilify Trump as racist,
xenopohobic, anti-muslim, etc… and draws upon the organized and controlled
nature of her political message in order to draw herself as a person who can be
seen as “presidential”. Even the word “presidential” is currently a loaded
word, easily seen as a stealthy stand-in for political correctness.</p>
<p>All of this is really a bunch of superficial rhetoric that nicely hides a very
real question about the kind of world we want to live in and it does this by
asking a slightly different set of questions.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>If being honest will hurt is it better to be honest or kind?</p></li>
<li><p>Do the ends justify the means? (Is being fake to be elected good because it’s
necessary to get the job in order to accomplish useful things?)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These are obviously cliche questions, ones that have been perpetually divisive
because they are overly general and inherently useless. They presuppose that
the answer to such questions isn’t highly contextual with answers lying across
a spectrum rather than being easily divided onto one side or the other. Despite
this, people often have personal preferences towards one side or the other in a
very general way, potentially indicative of a persons more general world-view.</p>
<p>To really think about this without the emotional baggage of the term, it’s
useful to step back and think about this in the abstract. The way questions or
statements are phrased is extremely important because it sets the context for
the way one thinks about what is being asked. Consider the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Does life begin at conception?</p></li>
<li><p>What are the rights of a woman who has conceived?</p></li>
<li><p>At what point to the rights of a fetus supersede the rights of the mother?</p></li>
<li><p>Do women have the right to control their own body?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these are dealing with the same underlying question. No matter your
feelings on the issue, it is clear that the framing of the question can make
the question sound very different. One could use any of those to try to pull
concessions out of a person with opposing views by forcing them to answer or
acknowledge THEIR version. This allows one to frame not just the question or
statement but the response and by proxy the respondent. Politically correct
speech (and it’s antithesis) is simply a manifestation of this idea.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We need to properly vet all Syrian immigrants entering our country to
maintain our safety.</p></li>
<li><p>Muslims attempting to enter America from Syria need additional vetting to
make sure they aren’t Islamic extremists.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Those annoyed by politically correct speech would consider the first phrasing
to be political cowardice. From that angle the first phrase is a refusal to
accept a particular reality. The utterer won’t acknowledge the religious
implications that seem blindingly obvious. He or she must be either fearful,
ignorant, or biased.</p>
<p>Flip the tables and you’ve got someone attempting to acknowledge that there is
a very real danger without framing the situation in a way that would either
compromise another value they hold (don’t discriminate based on race, religion,
ethnicity, etc…) or exacerbating existing sensitivities.</p>
<p>And all of that gets back to the heart of the situation. No matter what the
subject of any particular discourse, the way things are stated informs the
context and thus the way things are perceived. When people with very different
perspectives engage, part of the engagement involves maneuvering to guide the
other person to a place where they understand what you’re saying. Identifying
the perspective different allows us to actually enhance communication if both
parties are willing to play ball. Phrases like “let me put it to you this way”,
“picture this”, “imagine this scenario”, and others are pointers to this kind
of communication. This is an often overlooked but extremely valuable tool. If
one party won’t play ball though, it’s usually over an issue that reaches them
at a deep emotional level. This keeps them from actually seeing the other
perspective (note here that understanding an alternate perception is not at all
tantamount to agreeing with it).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">Jen: “I am anti-abortion.”</div>
<div class="line">Linda: “You must be a horrible person if you don’t believe that a woman has the right to control her own body!”</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
<div class="line">Bob: “I’m pro abortion.”</div>
<div class="line">Jake: “You must be a horrible person if you believe in murdering babies!”</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Both of these conversations actually LACK true communication. The parties don’t
see the other persons perspective because they’re too wrapped up in their own
emotions about the subject. Since they never engage properly no real
information was exchanged. Instead, people formed opinions about the person
before understanding them.</p>
<p>I know this is a long way around, but this is all critical if I want you to be
able to understand my perspective (even if you disagree with it). Think back to
your childhood. Did you ever witness anyone being harmed, either verbally or
physically? Did you step in and do anything about it? I think most people have
at least some memory like this. I have just such a memory and the thing that
bothers me about it the most is my own actions. I did nothing. The reason was
mostly fear, which I’ve internalized as a moment of extreme cowardice. Is the
person who was being harmed then fine now? Sure, but that doesn’t actually
matter. Here I sit in the seat of self judgment and I say that of all of the
people involved, my actions were the most egregious. It’s much easier to do
nothing than it is to stand up for someone.</p>
<p>By the same token it’s very easy to say that people just need to “toughen up”,
but at the end of the day we’re really considering what kind of world we want
to exist in. The reason I’m disappointed with that moment in my own past has
more to do with the fact that I’d rather exist in a world where people aren’t
being jerks to one another. By doing nothing I compromised my value system and
did nothing to bring about the change I desired.</p>
<p>People who are really concerned  about peoples sensitivities, that think people
just need to “toughen up”, are  looking for a different world than the one I
want. They want to live in a world where they don’t have to be as thoughtful
about what they say and how they say it (I imagine this could be characterized
as not wanting to feel like they are walking on eggshells all the time). They
don’t want the way they are in their heads to be offensive to anyone. They wish
the world was a place where people were more similar. Diversity is the enemy
here; the broad differences among people and their values directly gives rise
to the wider variety of sensitivities.</p>
<p>The reason people get hurt and offended deals directly with whether or not they
are understood as people. The reason I don’t understand  why a depiction of the
prophet Muhammad is offensive is that I don’t fully  understand the people that
offends. The reason I don’t understand why some people are so sensitive about
cursing or using racial slurs, or any other myriad of sensitives comes down to
my own lack of understanding of those people. I use the knowledge I have to try
to speak in an inclusive way because I want to express a degree of respect for
people I haven’t taken the time to know or comprehend.</p>
<p>This leaves me with an opportunity to give politically correct self the finger
and cast aside any semblance of restraint in order to express the general
thesis of this article:</p>
<p>People who find themselves genuinely upset about political correctness need to
stop whining, toughen up, and quit being a sensitive little bitch about it.</p>
