<p>Despite what the public response seems to have been, I’ve gotten many†personal

<p id="gog-neither-correct">Neither side is 100% correct and both viewpoints are necessary for a
functioning society or, in this case, company. A company too far to the right
may be slow to react, overly hierarchical, and untrusting of others. In
contrast, a company too far to the left will constantly be changing
(deprecating much loved services), over diversify its interests (ignoring or
being ashamed of its core business), and overly trust its employees and
competitors.</p>
<p>Only facts and reason can shed light on these biases, but when it comes to
diversity and inclusion, Google’s left bias has created a politically correct
monoculture that maintains its hold by shaming dissenters into silence. This
silence removes any checks against encroaching extremist and authoritarian
policies. For the rest of this document, I’ll concentrate on the extreme stance
that all differences in outcome are due to differential treatment and the
authoritarian element that’s required to actually discriminate to create equal
representation.</p>

<p>At Google, we’re regularly told that implicit (unconscious) and explicit biases
are holding women back in tech and leadership. Of course, men and women
experience bias, tech, and the workplace differently and we should be cognizant
of this, but it’s far from the whole story.</p>
<p>On average, men and women biologically differ in many ways. These differences
aren’t just socially constructed because:</p>
<ul class="simple" id="gog-gender-diff-list">
<li><p>They’re universal across human cultures</p></li>
<li><p>They often have clear biological causes and links to prenatal testosterone</p></li>
<li><p>Biological males that were castrated at birth and raised as females often
still identify and act like males</p></li>
<li><p>The underlying traits are highly heritable</p></li>
<li><p>They’re exactly what we would predict from an evolutionary psychology
perspective</p></li>
</ul>
<p id="gog-gender-cause">Note, I’m not saying that all men differ from all women in the following ways
or that these differences are “just.” I’m simply stating that the distribution
of preferences and abilities of men and women differ in part due to biological
causes and that these differences may explain why we don’t see equal
representation of women in tech and leadership. Many of these differences are
small and there’s significant overlap between men and women, so you can’t say
anything about an individual given these population level distributions.</p>

<p>Below I’ll go over some of the differences in distribution of traits between
men and women that I outlined in the previous section and suggest ways to
address them to increase women’s representation in tech without resorting to
discrimination. Google is already making strides in many of these areas, but I
think it’s still instructive to list them:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Women on average show a higher interest in people and men in things</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We can make software engineering more people-oriented with pair programming
and more collaboration. Unfortunately, there may be limits to how
people-oriented certain roles at Google can be and we shouldn’t deceive
ourselves or students into thinking otherwise (some of our programs to get
female students into coding might be doing this).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Women on average are more cooperative</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Allow those exhibiting cooperative behavior to thrive. Recent updates to
Perf may be doing this to an extent, but maybe there’s more we can do.</p></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t mean that we should remove all competitiveness from Google.
Competitiveness and self reliance can be valuable traits and we shouldn’t
necessarily disadvantage those that have them, like <a class="reference external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2000/05/the-war-against-boys/304659/">what’s been done in education.</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Women on average are more prone to anxiety</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Make tech and leadership less stressful. Google already partly does this
with its many stress reduction courses and benefits.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/jaro2011/SPP457/um/23632422/Hakim_2006.pdf">Women on average look for more work-life balance​</a> while men
have a higher drive for status on average</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unfortunately, as long as tech and leadership remain high status, lucrative
careers, men may disproportionately want to be in them. Allowing and truly
endorsing (as part of our culture) <a class="reference external" href="http://go/flexibility">part time work</a> ​though
can keep more women in tech.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The male gender role is currently inflexible</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Feminism has made great progress in freeing women from the female gender
role, but men are still very much tied to the male gender role. If we, as a
society, allow men to be more “feminine,” then the gender gap will shrink,
although probably because men will leave tech and leadership for
traditionally “feminine” roles.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Philosophically, I don’t think we should do arbitrary social engineering of
tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women. For
each of these changes, we need principled reasons for why it helps Google; that
is, we should be optimizing for Google—with Google’s diversity being a
component of that. For example, currently those willing to work extra hours or
take extra stress will inevitably get ahead and if we try to change that too
much, it may have disastrous consequences. Also, when considering the costs and
benefits, we should keep in mind that Google’s funding is finite so its
allocation is more zero-sum than is generally acknowledged.</p>

<p>I strongly believe in gender and racial diversity, and I think we should strive
for more. However, to achieve a more equal gender and race representation,
Google has created several discriminatory practices:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Programs, mentoring, and classes only for people with a certain gender or race​ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f5" id="id5" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>5<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p></li>
<li><p>A high priority queue and special treatment for “diversity” candidates</p></li>
<li><p>Hiring practices which can <a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/a/google.com/d/msg/coffee-beans-discuss/UVqCTkWXyZ4/ZwpFrceJCQAJ">effectively lower the bar​</a>
for “diversity” candidates by decreasing the false negative rate</p></li>
<li><p>Reconsidering any set of people if it’s not “diverse” enough, but not showing
that same scrutiny in the reverse direction (clear confirmation bias)</p></li>
<li><p>Setting org level OKRs for increased representation which can incentivize illegal
discrimination​ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f6" id="id6" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>6<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>These practices are based on false assumptions generated by our biases and can actually
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.businessforum.com/WSJ_Race-on-Campus-05-06-2016.pdf">increase race and gender tensions​</a>.
We’re told by senior leadership that what we’re doing is both the morally and
economically correct thing to do, but without evidence this is just veiled left
ideology​ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f7" id="id7" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>7<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ​ that can irreparably harm Google.</p>

<section id="why-we-re-blind">
<span id="echo-why-blind"></span><h2>Why we’re blind<a class="headerlink" href="#why-we-re-blind" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>We all have biases and use motivated reasoning to dismiss ideas that run
counter to our internal values. Just as some on the Right deny science that
runs counter to the “God &gt; humans &gt; environment” hierarchy (e.g., evolution and
climate change), the Left tends to <a class="reference external" href="https://www.city-journal.org/html/real-war-science-14782.html">deny science</a>
concerning biological differences between people (e.g., IQ​ <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f8" id="id8" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>8<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> ​ and sex
differences). Thankfully, climate scientists and evolutionary biologists
generally aren’t on the right. Unfortunately, the overwhelming majority of
humanities and social sciences lean left (<a class="reference external" href="https://heterodoxacademy.org/problems/">about 95%</a>), which
creates <a class="reference external" href="http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/social-psychology-biased-republicans">enormous confirmation bias</a>,
changes what’s being studied, and maintains myths like social constructionism
and the gender wage gap​ [#f9]_​ . Google’s left leaning makes us blind to this
bias and uncritical of its results, which we’re using to justify highly
politicized programs.</p>
<p>In addition to the Left’s affinity for those it sees as weak, humans are
generally biased towards protecting females. As mentioned before, this likely
evolved because males are biologically disposable and because women are
generally more cooperative and agreeable than men. We have extensive government
and Google programs, fields of study, and legal and social norms to protect
women, but when a man complains about a gender issue issue affecting men, he’s
labelled as a <a class="reference external" href="https://becauseits2015.wordpress.com/2016/08/06/a-non-feminist-faq/#addressing">misogynist and a whiner​</a> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#f10" id="id9" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>10<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> . Nearly
every difference between men and women is interpreted as a form of women’s
oppression. As with many things in life, gender differences are often a case of
“grass being greener on the other side”; unfortunately, taxpayer and Google
money is being spent to water only one side of the lawn.</p>
<p>This same compassion for those seen as weak creates political correctness​
[#f11]_​ , which constrains discourse and is complacent to the extremely
sensitive <a class="reference external" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-personality-of-political-correctness/">PC-authoritarians​</a>
that use violence and to advance their cause. While Google hasn’t harbored the
violent leftist protests that we’re seeing at universities, the frequent
shaming in TGIF and in our culture has created the same silent, psychologically
unsafe environment.</p>

<p>I hope it’s clear that I’m not saying that diversity is bad, that Google or
society is 100% fair, that we shouldn’t try to correct for existing biases, or
that minorities have the same experience of those in the majority. My larger
point is that we have an intolerance for ideas and evidence that don’t fit a
certain ideology. I’m also not saying that we should restrict people to
certain gender roles; I’m advocating for quite the opposite: treat people as
individuals, not as just another member of their group (tribalism).</p>
<p>My concrete suggestions are to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>De-moralize diversity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>As soon as we start to <a class="reference external" href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1467-9280.00139">moralize an issue</a>,
we stop thinking about it in terms of costs and benefits, dismiss anyone
that disagrees as immoral, and harshly punish those we see as villains to
protect the “victims.”</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stop <a class="reference external" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/rabble-rouser/201209/liberal-privilege-in-psychology">alienating conservatives</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Viewpoint diversity is arguably the most important type of diversity and
political orientation is one of the most fundamental and significant ways
in which people view things differently.</p></li>
<li><p>In highly progressive environments, conservatives are a minority that feel like
they need to
<a class="reference external" href="https://nypost.com/2016/04/17/conservative-professors-must-fake-being-liberal-or-be-punished-on-campus/">stay in the closet to avoid open hostility</a>.
We should empower those with different ideologies to be able to express themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>Alienating conservatives is both non-inclusive and generally bad business
because <a class="reference external" href="https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2011/08/18/4462041-liberals-conservatives-and-personality-traits">conservatives tend to be higher in conscientiousness</a>,
which is required for much of the drudgery and maintenance work
characteristic of a mature company.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Confront Google’s biases.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve mostly concentrated on how our biases cloud our thinking about
diversity and inclusion, but our moral biases are farther reaching than
that.</p></li>
<li><p>I would start by breaking down Googlegeist scores by political orientation
and personality to give a fuller picture into how our biases are affecting
our culture.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Stop restricting programs and classes to certain genders or races.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These discriminatory practices are both unfair and divisive. Instead focus
on some of the non-discriminatory practices I outlined.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Have an open and honest discussion about the costs and benefits of our
diversity programs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Discriminating just to increase the representation of women in tech is as
misguided and biased as mandating increases for women’s representation in
the homeless, work-related and violent deaths, prisons, and school
dropouts.</p></li>
<li><p>There’s currently very little transparency into the extent of our diversity
programs which keeps it immune to criticism from those outside its
ideological echo chamber.</p></li>
<li><p>These programs are highly politicized which further alienates
non-progressives.</p></li>
<li><p>I realize that some of our programs may be precautions against government
accusations of discrimination, but that can easily backfire since they
incentivize illegal discrimination.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Focus on psychological safety, not just race/gender diversity.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We should focus on psychological safety, which has shown positive effects
and should (hopefully) not lead to unfair discrimination.</p></li>
<li><p>We need psychological safety and shared values to gain the benefits of
diversity.</p></li>
<li><p>Having representative viewpoints is important for those designing and
testing our products, but the benefits are less clear for those more
removed from UX.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>De-emphasize empathy.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I’ve heard several calls for increased empathy on diversity issues. While I
strongly support trying to understand how and why people think the way
they do, relying on affective empathy—feeling another’s pain—causes us to
focus on anecdotes, favor individuals similar to us, and harbor other
<a class="reference external" href="https://bostonreview.net/forum/paul-bloom-against-empathy">irrational and dangerous biases</a>.
Being emotionally unengaged helps us better reason about the facts.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Prioritize intention.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Our focus on microaggressions and other unintentional transgressions
increases our sensitivity, which is not universally positive: sensitivity
increases both our tendency to take offence and our self censorship,
leading to authoritarian policies. Speaking up without the fear of being
harshly judged is central to psychological safety, but these practices can
remove that safety by judging unintentional transgressions.</p></li>
<li><p>Microaggression training
<a class="reference external" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/07/why-its-a-bad-idea-to-tell-students-words-are-violence/533970/?utm_source=twb">incorrectly and dangerously equates speech with violence</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691616659391?journalCode=ppsa">isn’t backed by evidence</a>.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Be open about the science of human nature.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Once we acknowledge that not all differences are socially constructed or due to
discrimination, we open our eyes to a more accurate view of the human
condition which is necessary if we actually want to solve problems.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Reconsider making Unconscious Bias training mandatory for promo committees.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We haven’t been able to measure any effect of our Unconscious Bias
training and it has the potential for overcorrecting or backlash,
especially if made mandatory.</p></li>
<li><p>Some of the suggested methods of the current training (v2.3) are likely
useful, but the political bias of the presentation is clear from the
factual inaccuracies and the examples shown.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend more time on the <a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jjycJDLHc9oixA7FiG3-M2yJ2GNbPmaDxzLpMYPO0PA/preview">many other types of biases</a>
besides stereotypes. Stereotypes are much more
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.spsp.org/blog/stereotype-accuracy-response">accurate and responsive to new information</a>
than the training suggests (I’m not advocating for using stereotypes, I
just pointing out the factual inaccuracy of what’s said in the training).</p></li>

<p>Instead set Googlegeist OKRs, potentially for certain demographics. We
can increase representation at an org level by either making it a better
environment for certain groups (which would be seen in survey scores) or
discriminating based on a protected status (which is illegal and I’ve seen
it done). Increased representation OKRs can incentivize the latter and
create zero-sum struggles between orgs.</p>

<p>Communism promised to be both morally and economically superior to
capitalism, but every attempt became morally corrupt and an economic
failure. As it became clear that the working class of the liberal
democracies wasn’t going to overthrow their “capitalist oppressors,” the
Marxist intellectuals transitioned from class warfare to gender and race
politics. The core oppressor-oppressed dynamics remained, but now the
oppressor is the “white, straight, cis-gendered patriarchy.”</p>

<p>Yes, in a national aggregate, women have lower salaries than men for
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.warrenfarrell.net/Summary/">a variety of reasons</a>. For
the same work though, women get paid just as much as men. Considering women
spend more money than men and that salary represents how much the employee
sacrifices (e.g. more hours, stress, and danger), we really need to rethink
our stereotypes around power.</p>

<p>“The traditionalist system of gender does not deal well with the idea
of men needing support. Men are expected to be strong, to not complain, and
to deal with problems on their own. Men’s problems are more often seen as
personal failings rather than victimhood, due to our gendered idea of
agency. This discourages men from bringing attention to their issues
(whether individual or group-wide issues), for fear of being seen as
whiners, complainers, or weak.”</p>

<p>Political correctness is ​defined​ as “the avoidance of forms of
expression or action that are perceived to exclude, marginalize, or insult
groups of people who are socially disadvantaged or discriminated against,”
which makes it clear why it’s a phenomenon of the Left and a tool of
authoritarians.</p>
