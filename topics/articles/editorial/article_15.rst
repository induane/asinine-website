A Declaration
=============

CONCEPTION JANUARY 28th 2017

This constitutes declaration unanimous among those who have seen fit to attach
their signature either in person or in digital form to this document. This is
not an absolute and total unanimity among the entirety of the population of the
United States of America, nor should it under any circumstance be regarded or
construed as such.

On July 4th of 1776, a document was drawn in the form of
:ref:`declaration_of_independence`. This document laid the initial foundation
for an independent society which would eventually become known as The United
States of America and contains the following passage:

    *When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people
    to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and
    to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
    which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect
    to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes
    which impel them to the separation.*

    *We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal,
    that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,
    that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to
    secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their
    just powers from the consent of the governed. That whenever any form of
    government becomes destructive to these ends, it is the right of the people
    to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its
    foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to
    them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.*

All things constructed must have a solid foundation upon which to build if they
are to endure. It is in this spirit that we hold that the values exuded in the
above passages are of sound mind and applicable to contemporary society as it
was applicable to the foundation of the United States of America.

Purpose of Government
---------------------

Preservation of the physical safety of those within it's borders, with priority
given to the gravity of known risks. Expenditure on prevention and security
should thus be proportional to the risk posed by each source of risk.

.. note:: This does not include recreational risk undertaken by independent
    actors. For instance, there should not be government expenditure or
    regulation on making rock climbing safer.

To lay and maintain an infrastructure and regulatory framework which enables
enterprise to prosper. This includes—but is not limited to—transportation
infrastructure (both bulk and personal),
