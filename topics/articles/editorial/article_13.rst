   All things are poison, and nothing is without poison, the dosage alone makes
   it so a thing is not a poison.

   â€” Paracelsus

*Wake up, check your phone. Go to work. Read the news in the bathroom. Read it
walking down the hall. Post about the latest outrage. Argue with people about a
topic on social media. Go home. Read more news. Watch personalities analyze the
news. Live it. Breath it. Let it consume you. Jump into the pool of news and
media and let it consume your thoughts. Yes, consume it. You're a consumer. Do
your job. Call it being informed. Call it caring about the issues. Call it
being engaged. Proclaim that it is meaningful and important. Tell yourself you
can stand apart from it; objective. Tell yourself it doesn't affect you.
Validate your actions.*

Problem
-------
**We are overdosing on media and it's poisoning us.**

An important human trait is ability to see and identify trends that are
relevant. Relevance is based on those things which we encounter more
frequently. As recently as a few hundred years the rate of information
propagation was slow enough that the daily life of people on one side of the
world had little to no effect on the lives of people on the other side of the
world. Since that information would never be encountered by either party
neither could have perceived it as relevant. In a modern world this is no
longer true. We choose which information to consume. The glut of available data
is filtered by our preferences instead of practical relevance. In other words,
relevance is now an ideologically driven concept.

A few weeks back I was walking through a small wooded area looking for morel
mushrooms. Having hunted for them every year since I was a child I knew what to
look for. No large Sycamore leaf could fully obscure one. I foraged,
experiencing the joy of discovering something edible in the wild. The season
for morels is fleeting but it's an enjoyable deviation from the loop of my
daily life. As I lay down to sleep the evening after a hunt I noticed
something. There swirling murkily in my minds eye was the vague image of a
morel mushroom. It hung behind my eyelids like the after-image you get when
you've looked at something bright; not exactly a full image but a leftover
impression still there saturating my mind.

The more you encounter something the better you become at finding it. Over time
you become attuned to the pattern and can easily spot it even when a novice
cannot. Become overly attuned and you begin to see it even when it's not there.
An animal in the clouds. An image in smoke. Two headlights and a grill conjure
a face. Abstract information is the canvas on which our minds paint.

It is this exact adaptation and ability that we have that means we need to be
more careful with the information we encounter. We fill ourselves with the
ritual of enjoying the clash of egos, arguments, attacks on ideas and
vilifications of generalized groups are now a hollow shell doing nothing except
vicariously living through media personalities and watching train wrecks like a
kid at the movies. We sit risking nothing while deifying some and vilifying
others, enjoying the fight itself, being okay with enjoying the pain of people
with whom we disagree, and perceiving those who see differently than us as an
incomprehensible dangerous enemy.

This is an illness of the soul wrought forth by the 24 hour news cycle and the
informational bubbles of social media. It sets a rot into peoples spirit which
denies the existence of a problem because it's predicated on some of the very
adaptations that helped simple tribes grow to be the sole custodians of an
entire planet. All this human success has done little for the happiness of the
individual. The human organism grows and changes without regards to the
individual cells that make it up.

We need to ask ourselves what value all of these inputs really hold for us. How
do they help us get more out of the time we're given? What do they do to the
way we see one another? Given that we can now choose what information we can
consume, what thought do we put into the information we use to feed our minds?
Is the dose worth some momentary catharsis as we laugh at how dumb someone
else's perspective is or watch them get "owned" by someone more informed? At
what point does this dose become a poison?

Solutions
---------
It is an oversimplification to distill a complex issue like this into a few
simple solutions. Thus don't take this as a list of possible ways to fix the
issue but rather as additional ways to meditate on the issues at hand. Most
people operate in some combination of these modes and probably in modes that
aren't listed here at all. In the long run the way forward is to find some way
to build a bridge of understanding between the very ideas that divide us.

.. _option1:

Option 1: War
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The simplest option is for everyone to confront and battle any opposing ideals.
Disparage the enemy. Hate their ideas. Refuse to understand them. Crush them if
it becomes untenable for both of you to exist simultaneously. Push your
ideology and rejoice when it's goals meet with success. Revel in the outrage of
the opposition when you score a victory, enjoying the pain of the opposition.
Rage or despair when your ideological goals are blocked or disrupted by others.
Push your agenda vigorously as if the only world you'd be happy to live in is
one where your ideas are sacrosanct. If the tide ever turns against you then
resort to whatever means are necessary to preserve your goals. Obstruct.
Cooperation is for cowards and the wishy-washy with no clear moral imperatives.
Hold the line no matter what and refuse to entertain alternative futures or any
idea that any of your core beliefs are possibly on shaky ground. You are the
warrior for truth and justice as you see it. Use whatever is at your disposal.
Do not be afraid to start a war where none existed in order to push forward.
Battle lines need drawn.

This may to some seem cynical but it is not without merit. Such a mode implies
a strong hierarchy and a clear direction from which values and action should
originate. Military has long recognized the efficacy of such a conceptual
system and gains much of its strength through forcing as much order and rigor
into the hierarchy as possible. An army with a broken command structure does
not operate as a single  unit with a single goal and it's ability to attain
goals is hindered. Attainment of a unified purpose is possible with enough
people buying into the ideas or with enough of the opposition destroyed or
stripped of voice and power.

.. _option2:

Option 2: Passive
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The passive path is not dissimilar to the path of the warrior but this path is
one of self indulgence. Believe in the war but participate only indirectly.
Vicariously live through those at war as an armchair quarterback content in the
knowledge that you would have made better choices if YOU were in charge or
confident in the infallibility of your hero of the week. Your job is to never
give any intellectual ground and to engage in elaborate self deception that
allows convince yourself that you gave other ideas a fair trial even while the
verdict was announced before the opening arguments. Dream of a future where you
have the authority to change the world. Believe fervently in your inner dream
that if you held the reigns then the world would be a better place if only you
weren't so inconsequential. Support the war and the warriors on your side of
ideas. If you're really in a dark place then engage with other people about
your ideas; not to listen but in order to convince them of the correctness of
your perspective. Listen only enough to find rebuttal but never enough to
really hear a person. People who don't come around to your way of thinking are
either stupid, ignorant or think you're stupid and/or ignorant. These people
deserve to be hurt and suffer because their perspective is stupid and they
disagree or they disrespect and attack your way of thinking about things. Here
one can passively demonize them. Say things merely to anger them. Poke and prod
them and let each little squeal of pain or outburst serve to reinforce your
smug sense of rightness. Use their responses to buttress your own point of
view. Don't ever identify with or empathize with these people. They probably
wouldn't empathize with you so you owe them nothing. These people are a problem
that needs to be dealt with.

While obviously more passive this is the tact taken by many regardless of their
perspective. It's not relegated to a single ideology although each ideology
adds their own style and flair and flavor to it. The distracted is the culture
which the warriors protect. It is the reason they do battle. An army needs
support and the passive element is a place from which to draw such support.

.. _option3:

Option 3: Distracted
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Rather than participating simply ignore all sides of things until they directly
confront you. If you're sad look for something to make you happy. Go out to eat
or watch television or a movie. Never give yourself fully to anything. Instead,
merely survive. The journey of life in the big scheme of things isn't very
important so what you do doesn't matter too much anyway. You're afraid of death
though so simply do whatever feels good and keeps you from considering the
inevitable. Work. Consume. This mode is important for capitalist society. Buy
things you don't need. Live in debt beyond your means because then you at least
have some pressure to get out of bed in the morning and go do your job. Try not
too think too hard about purpose or engage in empty religious ritual to tell
you that there is purpose. Deep down you don't believe it but that only wells
up when you've got too much time to think. This is your task; to keep running
as long as you can. Inevitability will catch up with you someday and you won't
be prepared to face it but the encounter will be brief and you'll deal with it
then. In the meantime, embrace the spectacle.

This is what a lot, though not all, people do frequently. When they can't
distract themselves anymore they typically will spend a bit of time in
:ref:`option1` or :ref:`option2` as an additional means of escapism. It might
not be a path to inner peace but it at least works well enough to get most
people through the day.

.. _option4:

Option 4: Reflection
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In all the raging turmoil of life, culture, social media, the 24 hour news
cycle, left vs right, nationalism vs globalism, etc... it's easy to feel adrift
or inconsequential. On a grand enough scale anything finite is a mere mote set
against an all encompassing darkness that renders it devoid of meaning and
purpose. But instead of looking outward one can look inward. Not inward in the
narcissistic ego driven naval gazing way that most people think of but rather
something deeper and more spiritual. What is it that we are? If we want to find
peace then is it not important to know what it is that *desires** peace?

Pursue these questions with curiosity and courage. It is far easier to look at
things and see them as broken as I have done with this article. Far harder is
the task of real solutions. Solutions begin with the self and not others but
admitting this can be a shot to the ego. "The problem isn't ME it's all these
jerks and idiots." No, the problem is you. The problem is me. The problems are
inside. They are the rot and darkness and fears that we project or ignore or
defy. There is no peace to be found in the 24 hour news cycle. It's designed to
appeal to our sense of spectacle and capitulates to the worst parts of
ourselves. It's one of our best designed distractions, allowing us to
participate passively in whatever war reinforces our existing views. But the
media is not the real problem.

If you were stripped bare free of the baggage of your life clean down to the
deepest parts of your soul so that you were once again as naive as a child, you
find would pieces of yourself that are currently missing or hidden. We bury or
kill aspects of ourselves because we're small and scared and sensitive. We
surround ourself with our own constructions designed to protect this piece of
ourselves. Forts go up. Walls. Abstractions. Intellectualizations.
Rationalizations. They attempt to protect the soft parts of our flank. Each
unkindness the world brought us is baked into a new brick for our
fortifications. Occasionally we are hurt so deeply that we cannot pull out the
blade leaving us unable to heal and which no fortification can protect.

When we stare out from our own fortifications we don't see the pure version of
anyone. We see *their* facades and forts and the blades they couldn't remove
protruding from them. Their design is unique to them but they were build for
the same fundamental reasons that our own were.

Some people look for places where others are still open and vulnerable or where
a blade still protrudes and attack that spot and enjoying the pain they cause.
To them the problem isn't their attacksâ€”it's that these people didn't have good
enough fortifications.

One of the most challenging things we can do as a human is to look beyond the
fortification and facades of a person and stare right down to past them into
the ineffable condition we all share and to love them unconditionally even as
they seek to harm us or others we love. It is tempting to give into fear and
pain and say we shouldn't have compassion for some people. This is a lie we
tell ourself. It can be done but it is something we must endeavor to do
willingly and with an open heart. The militant fighter murdering women and
children, the drug dealer, the abuser, the murderer, the suicide bomber, and
the troll were all once babies who wanted nothing but warmth and safety and
love and care and something terrible happened along the way. They're wounded
and carried along by the inertia of their own lives and forts and baggage and
pain. It is possible to carry understanding without condoning or excusing
actions. Compassion is a volitional act not a judgment and it's the first step
in healing your own persistent wounds. Not everyone is ready or willing to
heal.

So shut off your constant news feed. Purge your daily intake of hatred and
cathartic trolling and entrainment news and talking heads and sound-bites and
reading people you disagree with and getting riled up and bitching about the
state of things and just **stop**. Stop everything. Find stillness and quiet.
Peace. Look inward towards the piece of you that you're defending with your
fortifications and remember a deeply human child-like naivety that is capable
of unrestricted joy and trust and love and wonder and awe and allow this piece
of you to emerge and let it's emotions flow through you and cryâ€”cry for joy or
sadness for love lost or potential squandered or those who are wounded or for
your own wounds and be that person without the fort and stand before the
universe with humility, raw and bare and vulnerable and afraid and feel just
feel. It's not the world that is keeping that part of you locked away. It's
you.
