Parents, Stop Circumcising Your Baby Boys
=========================================

Your mind is probably screaming at me right now. Let's start over. Hi, I'm
Jesse. I won't pretend to be a doctor. I'm a concerned citizen and father of
four boys and I did not take my own advice. I'm not high right now. I won't
advise you to make a tinfoil hat to prevent aliens from reading your minds nor
will I tell you to stop vaccinating your children (though the libertarian in me
says you have that right and I'm very much pro parental rights). But, I am
imploring you to read with an open mind.

And we are off!

| "Hypocrite!"
| "Don't tell me what to do with my child!"
| "I'm circumcised!"
| "It's a religious practice!"
| "It's harmless!"
| "It has medical benefits!"
| "It's normal!"
|

This is just a short list of your potential reactions. Let's start with the
benefits of male circumcision directly from the
`Mayo Clinic <http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/circumcision/basics/why-its-done/prc-20013585>`_.

- **Easier hygiene**\ —Circumcision makes it simpler to wash the penis. Washing
  beneath the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis is generally easy, however.
- **Decreased risk of urinary tract infections**\ —The overall risk of urinary
  tract infections in males is low, but these infections are more common in
  uncircumcised males. Severe infections early in life can lead to kidney
  problems later on.
- **Decreased risk of sexually transmitted infections**\ —Circumcised men may
  have a lower risk of certain sexually transmitted infections, including HIV.
  Still, safe sexual practices remain essential.
- **Prevention of penile problems**\ —Occasionally, the foreskin on an
  uncircumcised penis can be difficult or impossible to retract (phimosis).
  This can lead to inflammation of the foreskin or head of the penis.
- **Decreased risk of penile cancer**\ —Although cancer of the penis is rare,
  it's less common in circumcised men. In addition, cervical cancer is less
  common in the female sexual partners of circumcised men.

I believe all of this is true. So the conversation is over. Stop reading, you
heard it here! (No please keep reading so that my ego is sufficiently
stroked—dammit that's some poor wording in a piece about circumcision... who is
editing this piece of—)

Let's dig into these facts about circumcision.

Easier hygiene... sure. How can I dispute this? Moving on to urinary tract
infections (UTI). Who wants one of those? They are terrible and sent from the
devil (speaking of the devil... If your reasoning is religious, I respect
that). But what are the chances you will get a UTI? According to the American
Academy of Pediatrics, your baby boy is ten times likelier to get a UTI in
their first year of life if they are uncircumcised. OMG! Ten times! Why this is
true, here are the actual numbers.

"It is estimated that 10 of 1000 (1%) uncircumcised male infants will develop a
UTI during the first year of life compared with 1 of 1000 (0.1%) circumcised
male infants." Source: `National Center for
Biotechnology Information <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1477524/>`__

So the chances go from .1% to 1% and can be reduced through good hygiene.

"Ok, but what about the decrease in sexually transmitted infections (STI)?"

From the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):

    When a man isn't circumcised, he still has the foreskin on his penis. The
    inner lining of the foreskin is different than other types of skin on the
    body and has more of the cells that HIV infects. The foreskin may also tear
    during intercourse, providing a way for HIV to infect the body. In
    addition, HIV may be able to survive in the space between the foreskin and
    the penis. Finally, uncircumcised men have a higher risk of getting other
    sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as syphilis or herpes, which can
    increase the risk of getting HIV if they or their partners have sores on
    their skin.

    Male circumcision reduces the risk of an HIV-negative man being infected by
    an HIV-positive woman by about 50%. Source: `Center for Disease Control <https://wwwn.cdc.gov/hivrisk/decreased_risk/male_circumcision.html>`_

This sounds damning. 50% is significant. In addition, the National Center for
Biotechnology Information (NCBI) adds that there are "... over 40 studies which
shows that male circumcision provides significant protection against HIV
infection; circumcised males are two to eight times less likely to become
infected with HIV." Source: `National Center for
Biotechnology Information <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1127372/#B2>`__

So, how many Americans have HIV in America? The CDC says there are more than
1.2 million Americans with HIV and 1 in 8 do not know they have it
(https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/statistics/overview/ataglance.html). They also go on
to say that men would contract HIV at a rate of 4 per 10,000 exposures and
women would contract it at a rate of 8 per 10,000 exposures through vaginal
intercourse (https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/risk/estimates/riskbehaviors.html). I will
note that a Ugandan study concluded that contracting HPV and Herpes increased
at rates of 30% and 25%, respectively. Though in their tests, "8 percent of
circumcised men and 10 percent of uncircumcised men in the study caught herpes;
18 percent of circumcised men and 28 percent of uncircumcised men contracted
HPV. (https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/news-blog/circumcision-cuts-risk-of-herpes-hp-2009-03-25/).
I think you get the point. It's low. And, whether or not you're circumcised, be
careful out there (the government made me add this part).

Finally, we get to penile cancer, which effects less than 1 in 100,000 people
globally (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139859/) and phimosis,
of which nearly all cases clear up by the child's teenage years
(http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/442617-overview).

But if the benefits are marginal, why did I personally have my sons
circumcised? That's a good question. For my first three, I really didn't even
think about it. It was just something you have done and the doctors would
whisper sweet nothings into my ear about it. Then came my fourth son. Finally,
I had done more research and I talked to the doctor about not having the
procedure done (he was a real jerk about it, too – test your doctor). His most
convincing argument was, "Why now?" I hadn't done it with three boys. Did I
really want this one to be different? My answer to that was, "no". A regretful,
"no".

If you have already had your son(s) circumcised... why did you? The "benefits"?
Or maybe it had to do with looks? "Normal," is in the eye of the beholder and
it's dependent on where you live. In the `United Kingdom <http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19072761>`_,
for instance, less than 10% of males are circumcised
while in the `United States <http://www.cbsnews.com/news/circumcision-rates-declining-health-risks-rising-study-says/>`_
it's around 81%.

"But, Jesse, what's the harm in having it done?"

I won't lie to you. The negative aspects, statistically speaking, are even more
marginal. There are conflicting studies about whether being circumcised has a
positive or negative effect on your sex life. Many of the studies are done on
men before and after circumcision. I think it's fairly obvious that removing
the skin protecting the head would decrease sensitivity( see... I know what
circumcision is). I'm still not a doctor, but I think this would desensitize
the head because of it coming into constant contact with everything (jeans,
underwear, I don't know what you do with it). Pain, taking too much or too
little of the foreskin, or the foreskin healing improperly, are other minor
side effects.

"What's the point?"

Before you make a decision that cannot be undone, I want you to ask yourself
why. Why circumcise your baby boys? Is it for looks? Should we treat our
children like they are no different than an animal getting their ears clipped?
Why have an unnecessary procedure done at all? If something were going to be
done to you that was permanent, wouldn't you want to make that decision
yourself? I won't tell you how to raise your children and I trust parents to
make the best decisions for their families. But, you have options. Don't allow
a doctor to talk you out of it like I did. Hopefully, this makes you think
twice and understand that circumcision isn't the only way.
