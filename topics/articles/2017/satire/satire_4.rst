Predicting the Future
=====================

If I could go back in time I would have put a bunch of money in bitcoin and
would now be a retired writer.

But I can't go back in time so ya'll are going to have to bail me out.

The real story is that a long time ago I was asked to invest in bitcoin and
join an exchange startup by a friend whose IRC name I recall only as genjix.
I of course denied politely so I could keep working for free on a now-defunct
open-source MMORPG.

Does anyone else have a similar story about missing the early-adopter
boat?
