In a stunning development, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) declared
"Basic Bitches" a terrorist organization. We reached out to a prominent "Basic
Bitch", Monica Scarlett, for comment.

**What do you think of the Southern Poverty Law Center's declaration?**

Monica—"My Pumpkin Spice Latte doesn't taste as fresh this morning." She
said, flipping her hair from one side to the other.

**Do you think you're being unfairly targeted?**

Monica—"No, Target is so 2015. I bought these boots online." She held up one
leg, keeping perfect balance, and showed me her glamorous new Ugg Boots.

**Do you want to respond to the Southern Poverty Law Center?**

Monica—"Uh, yeah! Look, I don't know whose leggings wouldn't fit over their fat
ass this morning, but the patriarchy isn't going to stop us from being strong
independent females. This is just another piece on the war on women. We are
going to continue to fight for our rights. Basic Bitches out!"—she said before
doing a pirouette and walking the other direction.

There you have it, folks! To the Basic Bitches, this means war... of the
Pumpkin Spice kind.
