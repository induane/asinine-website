A human who doesn't know how to write his own bio but does know how throw
together quotes he likes and then pretend that it's content.

*"A man's ethical behaviour should be based effectually on sympathy, education,
and social ties and needs; no religious basis is necessary. Man would indeed be
in a poor way if he had to be restrained by fear of punishment and hope of
reward after death."*
— Albert Einstein

*"Everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down
they are different from everyone else."*
— David Foster Wallace

*"For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love."*
— Carl Sagan

*"No reference is truly direct—every reference depends on some kind of coding
scheme. It's just a question of how implicit it is."*
— Douglas Hofstadter

*"I embrace my desire to feel the rhythm, to feel connected enough to step
aside and weep like a widow, to feel inspired, to fathom the power, to witness
the beauty, to bathe in the fountain, to swing on the spiral of our divinity
and still be a human."*
— Maynard Keenan
