Jesse Duckworth
===============
A product of the Hyborian Age, rumored to be the 12th son of Conan the
Barbarian and a scantily clad warrior woman, Valbrandr (you can call him
Jesse), was excavated from a melting glacier thanks to global warming. He
journeyed to America because he heard a call for (culture) warriors. Instead of
finding other battle hardened barbarians like himself, he found a society of
hipsters, yuppies, and feminists. Jesse prayed for Crom to take him but he soon
realized that through battling these ingrates, he might learn the riddle of
steel. He fights them with Neanderthalish ideas... and when that doesnâ€™t
work... an axe.
