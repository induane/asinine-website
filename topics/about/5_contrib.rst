Jessica Marie Baumgartner
-------------------------

Jessica's motto is: Adventure first, then write! When not running around
exploring nature, she chases after multiple versions of herself and feeds furry
babies. She is also the author of, `The Golden Rule <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B072C2V6SP/>`__ , `My Family Is Different <https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01G6EBHUA/>`__,"
and more. Her writing has won 3 Bards and Sages Awards, 2 New Apple Awards, 2
Missouri Writer's Guild Awards, and a Summer Indie Book Award. She is a current
member of the Missouri Writer's Guild, SCBWI, and works mostly with children's
stories, non-fiction, and a little spec fic. As a dyslexic Wiccan, Jess loves
all types of people but sometimes writes about Pagan issues and the fun of a
brain that works differently.
