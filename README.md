# Asinine Media Website

This project provides a static build for the Asinine Media website. The actual site is served [here](https://induane.github.io/asinine-website/)

## Quick Build

If you just want to clone the repository and rebuild the site:

```bash
$ make html
```


## Extending
You can add new articles easily. We stick them under folders by year. Each article is written in RST (Restructured Text). Be sure to
include them in one of the index.rst files.
