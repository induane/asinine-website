    Laid-Back Camp (ゆるキャン - Yurukyan)

.. warning:: Spoilers ahead


Yuru Camp is a 12 episode 2018 Anime with almost no plot. While for some shows
this would be a significant weakness, here it plays as an advantage. The stakes
are small, the presentation light, but it's also surprisingly moving.

The story revolves around two girls, Nadeshiko Kagamihara and Rin Shima with
the former being outgoing and the latter a seemingly introverted girl who
prefers camping by herself. The two meet and Nadeshiko begins becoming
interested in camping.

Episodes are light on plot, each moving the overarching story further along and
occasionally giving simple educational camping trips to the viewer. This might
not sound like enough to build a series around but that's the point. From
Rin, Nadeshiko learns to be more independent. From Nadeshiko, Rin learns to
enjoy the company of others more.

The entire series culminates in Nadeshiko gaining the independence to undertake
a solo camping trip. That's it. Everything builds towards the final moment
which is simple but touching (and I won't give away everything).

Often as adults we forget how monumental something like that can seem. We rush
into adulthood as fast as we can, each milestone feeling monumental. But at
some point we look back and milestones in our steps towards independence no
longer seem as big. Laid-Back Camp captures the wonder and gives the gift of
letting the little things seem big again.
